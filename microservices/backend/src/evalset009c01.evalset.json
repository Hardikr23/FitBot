Make sure to follow up with your doctor as scheduled to monitor healing progress. They may take X-rays to see how the fracture is healing.\n"

                "text": "Okay, given that you're following a keto diet and need to support bone healing from a hairline fracture, it's crucial to focus on keto-friendly foods rich in calcium, vitamin D, and protein. I'd also advise consulting with your dietician, informing them about the fracture so they can adjust your diet plan to optimize bone healing.\n\nHere are some keto-friendly foods that support bone health:\n\n*   **Dairy (if tolerated):** Hard cheeses like Parmesan and cheddar are relatively low in lactose and high in calcium. Heavy cream and butter are keto-friendly options but offer less calcium.\n*   **Leafy Greens:** Spinach, kale, and collard greens provide some calcium, though it may not be as easily absorbed as calcium from dairy.\n*   **Fatty Fish:** Salmon, mackerel, and tuna are excellent sources of vitamin D, which is essential for calcium absorption. They also provide omega-3 fatty acids, which may help reduce inflammation.\n*   **Bone Broth:** While not a significant source of calcium, bone broth contains minerals and collagen that can support bone health.\n*   **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, chia seeds, and flaxseeds provide some calcium and healthy fats.\n*   **Eggs:** A good source of protein and contain some vitamin D.\n\n**Important Considerations for Bone Healing on Keto:**\n\n*   **Calcium:** Aim for adequate calcium intake through food sources or supplements if necessary.\n*   **Vitamin D:** Supplementation may be needed, especially if you have limited sun exposure.\n*   **Protein:** Ensure you're getting enough protein to support tissue repair and bone matrix formation. Good keto-friendly sources include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and cheese.\n*   **Electrolytes:** Keto diets can lead to electrolyte imbalances, so ensure you're getting enough sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These electrolytes are also important for overall health and recovery.\n*   **Collagen:** Consider adding collagen peptides to your diet, as collagen is a major component of bone.\n*   **Limit Processed Foods:** Focus on whole, nutrient-dense keto-friendly foods.\n\nSince you are on a strict keto diet, drastic changes might not be sustainable or necessary. Instead, focus on optimizing your current diet with the additions I mentioned. To get more tailored advice, I can use a tool to query a sports nutrition database if you provide me with a more specific question.\n"

                "text": "Calculating your exact caloric needs requires a comprehensive assessment, but I can offer a general estimate based on your age, sex, height, weight, activity level (as a basketball player), and injury status (hairline fracture). Keep in mind that this is an estimation, and consulting with your dietician for personalized recommendations is essential, especially given your keto diet and fracture recovery.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** This is the number of calories your body burns at rest. We can estimate this using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which is considered more accurate:\n\n    *   BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5\n    *   BMR = (10 x 64) + (6.25 x 180) - (5 x 17) + 5\n    *   BMR = 640 + 1125 - 85 + 5\n    *   BMR ≈ 1685 calories\n\n2.  **Activity Factor:** Since you're a professional basketball player, you have a high activity level. We also need to consider the healing process from your fracture. I'll use an activity factor of 1.6 to account for both your high activity level and the increased caloric needs for recovery.\n\n    *   Total Calorie Needs = BMR x Activity Factor\n    *   Total Calorie Needs = 1685 x 1.6\n    *   Total Calorie Needs ≈ 2696 calories\n\nTherefore, a general estimate for your daily calorie needs is around 2696 calories. However, it's important to monitor your body's response and adjust your intake based on how you feel and any changes in your weight or body composition.\n\nTo optimize your nutrition plan for the fracture I can use the `get_nutrition_advice_tool` if you have any more specific question.\n"
